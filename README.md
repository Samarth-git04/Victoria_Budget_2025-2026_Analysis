# Victoria Budget 2025‑2026 Analysis

> A visual deep‑dive into Victoria’s State Budget—tracking revenue streams, economic drivers, and cashflow health to inform strategic planning.

> Note : This was mostly a "fun" self project I did. So, I haven't thought much of a practical value for this.

## Charts & Insights

### 1. **Tax Revenue by Brackets**  
![Tax Revenue by Brackets](images/Tax_Revenue_by_Brackets.png)  
Shows historical and forecasted revenue (1995–2030) for key categories: payroll tax, stamp duties, land tax, mining royalties, etc.  
- **Observation:** Payroll tax (teal) accelerates after 2015, overtaking stamp duties (purple) by 2022.  
- **Forecast:** Steady growth across all streams, with payroll and stamp duties driving 70 % of total revenue by 2028.

### 2. **Average Annual Growth Rate: Key Macro Indicators**  
![Average Annual Growth Rate](images/Average_Annual_Growth_Rate.png)  
Ranked bar chart of compound annual growth (2018–2026) for unemployment, taxation, GSP, WPI, CPI, employment, and population.  
- **Observation:** Unemployment rate shows the fastest average change (6.45 %), reflecting extreme swings during the pandemic.  
- **Taxation & GDP:** Total tax receipts (5.37 %) and nominal GSP (4.99 %) outpace inflation (CPI 2.65 %), indicating real revenue growth.

### 3. **Budget Surplus/Deficit Relative to Economy**  
![Budget Surplus/Deficit](images/Cashflow_as_pct_of_GSP.png)  
Line chart of net cashflow as a % of real GSP (1996–2022).  
- **Observation:** Stable surplus of ~0.5–1.0 % pre‑COVID; sharp deficit of –2.5 % in 2020, rebounding to +0.7 % by 2022.  
- **Implication:** Pandemic relief drove a one‑off deficit but fiscal balance is projected to restore within two years.

### 4. **Nominal Vs. Real GSP**  
![Nominal Vs. Real GSP](images/Nominal_Vs_Real_GSP.png)  
Dual‑axis trends for Victoria’s gross state product in nominal and real terms.  
- **Observation:** Nominal GSP (orange) steadily rises from $270 B to $600 B; real GSP (blue) lags pre‑2021 but converges post‑2021.  
- **Insight:** Inflation-adjusted growth confirms underlying economic expansion, not just price effects.

### 5. **Net Cashflow vs. Total Taxation**  
![Net Cashflow Vs. Total Taxation](images/Net_Cashflow_Vs_Total_Taxation.png)  
Overlay of net cashflow ($B) and total tax revenue ($B) with forecast shading.  
- **Observation:** Taxation (orange) climbs from $8 B to $50 B by 2028; cashflow (blue) fluctuates around $3–5 B, dipping into -$13 B in 2020.  
- **Takeaway:** Robust revenue growth cushions episodic cashflow shocks.

### 6. **Employment Composition**  
![Employment Pie Chart](images/Employment_Pie_Chart.png)  
Current workforce breakdown: employed vs. unemployed vs. not in labour force.  
- **Numbers:** 3.68 M employed, 153 K unemployed, 3.14 M out of labour force.  
- **Context:** 4.0 % unemployment aligns with national benchmarks and supports revenue forecasts tied to payroll taxes.
